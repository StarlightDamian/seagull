Finitely repeated games have distinct characteristics that differentiate them from other types of games in game theory. Here are the key features:

### 1. **Finite Horizon**:

- The game is played for a specific number of rounds or stages, known to all players. Each player is aware of how many rounds will be played before the game ends.

### 2. **Repetition of a Stage Game**:

- The game consists of the repetition of a single, underlying game (often referred to as the "stage game"). This stage game is played repeatedly in each round of the repeated game.

### 3. **Backward Induction**:

- Players often analyze the game using backward induction, particularly when the number of repetitions is small. They start by considering the final round and reason backward to determine their strategy in earlier rounds.
- In the last round, since there is no future consequence, players usually play a Nash equilibrium of the stage game, ignoring any potential punishments or rewards from earlier rounds.

### 4. **Possibility of Cooperation Breakdown**:

- In the early rounds, players might cooperate or play strategies that are not Nash equilibria of the stage game in anticipation of future rewards or punishments. However, as the game approaches the final round, the incentive to cooperate decreases, often leading to a breakdown in cooperation in the later stages.

### 5. **Subgame Perfect Equilibrium**:

- The equilibrium concept often used in finitely repeated games is subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE), which requires that players' strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of the repeated game.
- In many cases, the subgame perfect equilibrium of a finitely repeated game will involve playing the Nash equilibrium of the stage game in every round, particularly in the final round.

### 6. **Limited Commitment**:

- Since the game has a known endpoint, players may have limited commitment to cooperative strategies, especially as the game nears its end. They are aware that any cooperative behavior will not be rewarded in future rounds once the game ends.

### 7. **Possibility of Multiple Equilibria**:

- Depending on the payoffs and the number of repetitions, finitely repeated games can have multiple equilibria. Players may coordinate on different strategies in different rounds, depending on their expectations of others' behavior.

### 8. **Strategic Complexity**:

- Despite being finite, these games can involve complex strategic considerations, especially if players consider various punishment and reward strategies across different rounds.

### 9. **Endgame Effect**:

- As players approach the final round, they may alter their strategies, leading to a phenomenon known as the "endgame effect," where players' behavior changes markedly as the game nears its conclusion.

In summary, finitely repeated games are characterized by the repetition of a stage game over a finite number of rounds, where players' strategies are influenced by the impending end of the game and their expectations of others' behavior in each round.
